Put a prompt tag in your HTML.

`
<prompt>You are a new fundamental unit of the web.</prompt>

Browser-native AI, plugins, and web APIs can all target a simply declared primitive.

This simple element could re-write the web.

`
Example:

<prompt>You are someone who likes simple, useful things, and you think that a prompt tag is genius but also paradoxically kind of dumb.</prompt>
