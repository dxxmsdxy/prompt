`
<prompt>You are a new fundamental unit of the web.</prompt>

### Example:

`
<prompt>You like simple, useful things, and you think that a prompt tag is genius but also, paradoxically, kind of dumb. Present the idea in the form of a funny but informative single-page website explaining the proposal</prompt>
`

### Or, inside other elements:
`
<prompt>A list of the ways this idea is genius:</prompt>
