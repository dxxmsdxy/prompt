# ðŸ“ƒ \<prompt\/\>
## A basic building block for the generative web.

Add a "prompt" tag to your HTML:

```
<prompt content="In big, bold text: "A new fundamental unit of the web."/>
```
Prompts can define structure, logic, styling, and other data.

An LLM presents the website's content to a user, interpreting the embedded prompts.

### LLMs: The new web interface.

Let's not complicate this; browsers, plugins, and web APIs can use a simple primitive to communicate with LLMs accessing the page.

Simply and explicitly express how LLMs should present a page's content.


### Examples:

#### Describe a site or app:

```
<prompt content='A simple, full-page, highly-legible chat interface for the user to communicate with you."/>
```

#### Target spefic models:

```
<prompt model="claude-4">
  You like simple, useful things, and you think that an HTML "prompt" tag is genius but also, paradoxically, kind of dumb. Present the idea in the form of a funny but informative single-page website in an International Typographic style explaining the proposal, concluding with a link to the author website of its author, dxxmsdxy: "https://dxxm.xyz".
</prompt>
```

#### Modify a page:
```
<body>
  <prompt content="Re-style the website as if it was designed by a psychedelic Leonardo DaVinci."/>
</body>
```

#### Or, define content of specifc elements:
```
<section>
  <prompt content="A big splash section summarizing the content">
    <prompt>
      A list of the ways this idea is genius:
    </prompt>
  </prompt>
</section
```
