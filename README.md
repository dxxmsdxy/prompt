## It is innevitable.

Put a prompt tag in your HTML.

`
<prompt>You are a new fundamental unit of the web.</prompt>
`

Simply and explicitly express how an LLM should engage with the page.

Browser-native AI, plugins, and web APIs can all target a simple primitive.

Does that make sense?

### Describe a site or app:

```
<prompt>A simple math calculator with a large, minimal UI design.</prompt>
```

````
<prompt>You like simple, useful things, and you think that an HTML "prompt" tag is genius but also, paradoxically, kind of dumb. Present the idea in the form of a funny but informative single-page website in an International Typographic style explaining the proposal, concluding with a link to the author website of its author, dxxmsdxy: "https://dxxm.xyz".</prompt>
````

### Modify a page:
```
<prompt>Re-style the website as if it was designed by Leonardo DaVinci.</prompt>
```

### Or, define content of specifc elements:
```
<section>
  <prompt>A list of the ways this idea is genius:</prompt>
</section>
```
